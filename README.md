## Michael Arnott

A problem solver by nature, with a highly quantitative background, and a creative streak that has blossomed since learning to code at Makers Academy. Previously worked within a small ecommerce team at Hewlett-Packard performing website optimisation; with complete exposure to the running of a managed service including working alongside developers. Looking to join an outgoing team that is focused on agile and test driven development; where I can cement best practices learned at Makers and continue to grow.
