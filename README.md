## Michael Arnott

A problem solver by nature, with a highly quantitative background, and a creative streak that has blossomed since learning to code at Makers Academy. Previously worked within a small ecommerce team at Hewlett-Packard performing website optimisation; with complete exposure to the running of a managed service, including working alongside developers. Now looking to grow as a full stack junior developer by joining an outgoing team that is focused on agile and test driven development.


## Skills

#### Ruby on Rails

Ruby is what inspired me to become a developer. I undertook several short C++ courses at university but the simplicity of Ruby is what finally allowed me to start building 'real' things. I love logic and puzzles; ruby suddenly allowed me to begin using that part of my brain to be creative in a very natural way - something i'd never experienced before.

My final project at Makers was <a href="https://github.com/arnottmj/selecta-official" target="_blank">Selecta</a>. The app aims to provide simple music discovery. It uses a rails framework with angular front end, offering continuous music playback across the whole site. I wrote the music suggestion alogithm in ruby.

Im also proud of a re-code of the <a href="https://github.com/arnottmj/inject-challenge" target="_blank">inject challenge</a> that I wrote; offering full functionality with appropriate guard controls.

#### Analytics

Two years of working full time as an analyst across the ecommerce and oil/gas sectors means that I have experience working with large datasets. At Hewlett Packard, I mainly performed multivariate website testing, having specialised in statistics whilst studying for my BSc in Mathematics. Two of the accounts I worked on were Office Depot and Debenhams; both of whom renewed $200,000 contracts.
